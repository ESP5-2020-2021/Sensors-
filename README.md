# Sensors-
Basically the control algorith from the TD1

This show the value of the 8 line sensors as a graph with 4 = detected and 0 = not detected

It also returns the value of sonar telling how much distance has been detected from the sensor

To change the angle of sensor just modify the servomotor value at the begining of the programme

If you want to see the angle of the sonar then in the mobile-platform under the session settings, make sure you enable "show range measurements" and then you 
will get the blue arc showing the sensitiviy of the sonar
